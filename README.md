Built an Image Captioning model using Python on the Flickr8k dataset.  
Implemented and compared two approaches: a CNN-LSTM model and a Hugging Face transformer model.  
The Hugging Face model achieved more accurate and coherent captions by connecting image features with meaningful language using Computer Vision and NLP concepts.
